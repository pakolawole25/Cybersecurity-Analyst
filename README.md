## About Me
**Profile***

<img src="assets/35mmX45mm.jpg" width="100">
*Experienced IT cybersecurity agent and systems administrator*


Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio showcasing four practical, hands-on projects completed during my training at Darey.io. These projects demonstrate my technical expertise in network security, incident response, access control, and secure network design through real-world simulations and best practices in addition to my on-the-job experiences in cybersecurity.
As an accomplished IT Systems Manager, I specialize in designing, deploying, and optimizing secure and scalable infrastructure solutions across on-premise and cloud environments. My track record includes leading cross-functional teams, implementing ITIL-based service frameworks, and maintaining IT security posture for financial, hospitality, and enterprise environments.

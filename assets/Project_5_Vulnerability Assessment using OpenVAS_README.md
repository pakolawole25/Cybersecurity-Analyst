# Project 5: Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation Risk Analysis Using OpenVAS

## Executive Summary
Performed a simulated penetration testing exercise focused on vulnerability identification and exploitation risk assessment using OpenVAS. This project replicated real-world reconnaissance and enumeration phases to evaluate the security posture of a target network. Critical vulnerabilities were identified, analyzed for potential exploitation paths, and documented with prioritized remediation strategies to strengthen the organization's defense against cyber threats.

## Project Overview
- Conducted vulnerability enumeration across simulated enterprise networks.
- Identified critical risks exploitable by attackers (e.g., outdated software, weak credentials).
- Analyzed vulnerabilities within the context of penetration testing workflows.
- Delivered actionable security recommendations to reduce attack surface.
- Reinforced the importance of proactive vulnerability management in cyber defense.
